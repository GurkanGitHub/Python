    "\tPip Installs Packages\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\tØ What is pip?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\t\t• pip is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages.It connects to an online repository of public packages, called the Python Package Index. pip can also be configured to connect to other package repositories (local or remote), provided that they comply to Python Enhancement Proposal 503.\n",
    "\t\t\t• Most distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled. Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip (pip3 for Python 3) by default.\n",
    "\t\t\t• First introduced as pyinstall in 2008 by Ian Bicking (the creator of the virtualenv package) as an alternative to easy_install, pip was chosen as the new name from one of several suggestions that the creator received on his blog post.\n",
    "\t\t\t• According to Bicking himself, the name is a recursive acronym for \"Pip Installs Packages\".In 2011, the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) was created to take over the maintenance of pip and virtualenv from Bicking, led by Carl Meyer, Brian Rosner, and Jannis Leidel.\n",
    "\t\t\t• With the release of pip version 6.0 (2014-12-22), the version naming process was changed to have version in X.Y format and drop the preceding 1 from the version label.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t• After you develop yourself in the Python programming, you will start to take part in more professional projects. Over time you will see that you will have to benefit from the packages in almost all of your programs. This rich package library is one of the factors that make Python programming language powerful.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t• In fact, the package library we're talking about here isn't built-in and you need to install it externally. That's where the pip comes in. pip which is also a preinstalled program in Python is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install/uninstall, and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard modules. The acronym of Pip Installs Packages is mostly known as pip.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\t\t• You can use pip not only to give additional functionality to the standard library by installing additional packages on your computer, but you can also use it to help you contribute to Python's development by sharing your own projects.\n",
    "\t\t\t\n",
    "\t\tØ Now open your command prompt and run the following syntax to make sure that you have pip installed.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t\tpip --version\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\tThis code should display your valid pip version which is 19.3.1 currently. The output will be :\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\tpip 19.3.1\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "\t\tIf you have problems with installing or upgrading pip, you can follow the official guide for the best practice.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t💡Tips:\n",
    "\t\t\t• When you install the Anaconda-3 package program, you will also automatically install hundreds of packages in addition to Python's standard library.\n",
